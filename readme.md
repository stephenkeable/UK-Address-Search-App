# UK Address search app for Mac OS X

Basic swift desktop application I've built that calls the address lookup API from Allies Computing, called PostCoder Web.

Built as a little project to try and learn Swift, outside of my day job at Allies Computing 

**Note** This is a personal project and not supported by Allies directly

Please let me know of issues or better ways to do things via GitHub issues.

## TODO

 - Currently only shows first 100 results
 - Make a prefs pane for adding your API key
 - Add templating for the final address output
 - Allow searching more than the UK
 - Refine the code where possible as I get better at Swift
